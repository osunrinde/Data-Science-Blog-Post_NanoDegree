# CAN PROGRAMMING BE LEARNT AT ANY AGE?

## Project Objective
Recently, technology (automation) has been the order of the day. Different industries has now begin to employ the automated way of executing business related tasks rather than the old (manual) ways of doing things. They have found it to be more efficient, not time consuming, and cost effective. Regardless of any automation process employed by these industries, there is always an element of programming behind it. People (especially older generations) are scared that programmers will be employed to take their role. Should they give up easily? Can they still delve into technology and save their career? This and many more will be answered using the stackoverflow 2021 survey

## Project Questions

The following questions will be analyzed using the stackoverflow 2021 survey and python data analytics libraries:

1. What are the Top and Least 30 countries whose developers uses stackoverflow?

2. How many of these developers uses python and what is their gender break down?

3. At what Age with respect to their gender did they start learning Python?

## DATASET
The DATASET used for this analysis can be find here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021

## RESULTS
The result of the analysis is can be find here: https://github.com/osunrinde/Data-Science-Blog-Post_NanoDegree.git

## Project Findings
From the whole analysis performed on Stack Overflow 2021 survey, the following conclusion was reached:

1. The United States of America has the higest number of developers that uses stackoverflow with a percentage of 18%. This is followed closely by India with a percentage of 12%.

2. Papua New Guinea including six different countries has the lowest number of developers that uses stack overflow.

3. From the top thirty countries considered during this analysis, 1096 developers enjoys coding with Python. 89% are men, 6% are women, 1% are trangender, and 3% are not sure of their gender. In genereal, Men prefer to code with pyton in these countries.

4. 51% attempted coding with python for the first time when they were a teenager, 32% attempted python for the first time whey they were at the young adulthood stage and, 0.018% attempted coding with python at old age.

In conclusion, irrespective of age or gender delving into technology is possible.

## Further analysis
1. How many years have they coded for?
2. Are they interested in coding with other languages?
3. Baye Naive Analyis: how much did they like coding with python with respect to other language
4. What platform do they enjoy coding with?
